I am an analyst with experience working on business-critical data pipelines, dashboards, and metrics used by stakeholders for decision-making.

My work typically involves investigating metric discrepancies, validating data models, and translating ambiguous business questions into clear analytical outputs. I focus on correctness, clarity, and decision impact rather than surface-level reporting.
